# MD_MCRI_b2f_challenge
Repo for the analysis with the data shared by MCRI and MD for the B2F challenge.

proteomics_challenge.py contains all the code used.

A first pre-processing step with a variance stabilizing normalization is executed.

Afterwards a PCA is executed and the resulting components used as input for t-SNE.
t-SNE is a dimensionality reduction algorithm very useful for visualizing how data is organized in human readable dimensions (2 and 3).
The power of t-SNE helps understand visually if and how data aggregates in similar groups.
Afterwards in order to have a way to detect p√≤ssible groups in a more robust way, a k-means is executed on top of the t-SNE results. This unsupervised learning
algorithm will help us to classify our data in different groups, clusters.
In order to find the optimal number of k-means clusters we use the elbow method to search between 1 and 15 clusters.

This script can now be edited and used in other proteomics datafiles with the same structure as the challenge dataset.
